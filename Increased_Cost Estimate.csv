In order to enhance redundancy and improve performance while targeting a monthly estimate of a maximum of $20,000, several changes were made to the existing infrastructure. The sizes of the web servers and application database were increased to accommodate higher traffic loads and ensure smoother operation. Additionally, services such as Amazon GuardDuty and Amazon CloudWatch were added to bolster security monitoring and performance optimization. Route 53 was introduced to enhance DNS management and WAF (Web Application Firewall) was implemented to fortify web application security against potential threats. These adjustments aim to strengthen the overall resilience and efficiency of the infrastructure within the specified budget constraints.
