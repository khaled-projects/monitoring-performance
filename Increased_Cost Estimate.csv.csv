To target a maximum monthly estimate of $20,000 while enhancing redundancy and performance, several changes were made to the infrastructure. Firstly, Multi-AZ deployment was re-enabled for RDS to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. Additionally, RDS Proxy was added to improve scalability and manageability of database connections, ensuring all requests are efficiently handled. Secondly, the size of the database was increased to accommodate the growing demand, and Performance Insights was enabled for 12 months to gain valuable performance metrics and leverage AWS Support benefits for the first year to ensure smooth operation and timely assistance in case of any issues. These adjustments collectively enhance the reliability, scalability, and performance of the infrastructure while staying within the specified budget.
