In order to align with the reduced budget, adjustments were made to the EC2 instance sizes.
Specifically, the instance types for both the web servers and application servers were downscaled to t3.medium. 
This choice offers a balance of performance and cost-effectiveness suitable for handling user requests and application logic.
Additionally, the database instance size was adjusted to an m5.large instance type, which provides ample resources for hosting the database while keeping costs in check. These changes were made to optimize costs while ensuring the infrastructure remains functional and scalable for the social media application's needs.
