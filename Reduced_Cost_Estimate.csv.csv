For the cost-effective planning of the AWS infrastructure for the new social media application, both the database and the application architecture were simplified to a single Availability Zone (AZ). This involved removing the additional web servers and application servers in the second AZ, along with the read replica and database instance in the other AZ. These changes significantly reduce costs by minimizing the number of resources deployed while still maintaining the necessary services for 50,000 single-region users, thus balancing cost and performance effectively.
